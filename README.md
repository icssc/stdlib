# @icssc/stdlib

A set of utilities used across ICSSC Projects.

## Contributing

- Each utility should be entirely self-contained. Notably, this means that no external dependencies are allowed, and no references to other utilities in the library are allowed. Also, each source file should contain only one utility (except for `index.ts`).
- When adding a utility, comprehensive tests must be included.
